# TestMockApi

### The Main purpose 
The main purpose of this project was to use mockapi.io to understand better how REST API works for creating web requests and getting responses from the server to update data on the client. 

### 1. MockAPI Integration
- Utilized mockapi.io for simulating RESTful API endpoints.
- Implemented HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with the API.

### 2. Asynchronous Programming with UniTask
- Leveraged UniTask for handling asynchronous operations in Unity.
- Executed network requests asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread and improve performance.

### 3. Dependency Injection with Zenject
- Employed Zenject for dependency injection to manage object composition and reduce coupling.
- Injected dependencies such as HTTP client, repository, views, and factories into the relevant classes.

### 4. UI Animation with DOTween
- Integrated DOTween for smooth UI animations, particularly for popup windows.
- Created visually appealing transitions using DOTween's tweening capabilities.

### 5. Particle System Visualization
- Implemented particle systems to enhance the visual feedback for button interactions.
- Utilized a custom script to integrate particle systems into the UI elements seamlessly.
